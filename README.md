## What is Neural Intelligence?

Neural Intelligence is NINK’s approach to **recording and validating human–AI work sessions** — not just storing chat text, but capturing what occurred (messages, attachments, environment, unexposed files) and anchoring a cryptographic proof on-chain.

DealCheck applies Neural Intelligence ideas to grocery shopping. This repo holds the **cross-industry foundation**: the browser plugin and session audit model.

## Phase 1: Browser plugin

**Path:** [`browser-plugin/`](browser-plugin/)

Chrome Manifest V3 extension that:

- Scrapes multi-platform AI chats (ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, Grok, Perplexity, Copilot, etc.)
- Captures images, documents, video references, and audit metadata
- Encrypts the session locally (AES-256-GCM) into a `.nink` + `.ninkkey` pair
- Anchors a SHA-256 state hash to Base Sepolia (dev stubs supported offline)
- Decrypts and renders sessions in `browser-plugin/viewer.html`

### Quick start

1. Chrome → `chrome://extensions` → **Load unpacked**
2. Select the `browser-plugin/` folder
3. Open a supported AI chat tab → extension popup → **Press NINK to Sign-Off**
4. Decrypt in the viewer: serve `browser-plugin/` over HTTP (not `file://`) and drop `.nink` + `.ninkkey`

```powershell
node browser-plugin/scripts/dev-stub-server.mjs   # optional accounting/anchor stubs
```

### Session audit payload (encrypted)

Each sign-off includes an **`auditRecord`** with:

- `interactionSummary` — plain-language session description
- `sessionContext` — URL, model, title, turn counts, scroll audit
- `environmentTelemetry` — user agent, screen, timezone offset, viewport
- `unexposedMediaManifest` — PDFs/audio/video referenced but not in DOM at sign-off
- `exposedMediaManifest` — successfully captured files
- `interactionTimeline` — ordered message + attachment events
- `signOffContext` — fee, balance, identity proof address (when wired)

See [`browser-plugin/README.md`](browser-plugin/README.md) for version and schema details.
